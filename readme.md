# Classifying If a Plant is Healthy or Not

 This project is about identifying if a plant is healthy or not. The dataset I used was for veggies and fruits but by putting your image in you can identify your own plants.

## The Algorithm

Jetson Nano was used to create this project and so was the retrained resnet18 model. A variety of fruits and veggiesÂ make up the dataset I used for this project. The plants are labeled by the type of plant, and if it has a disease, the type of disease. When it runs, it utilizes the imagenet.py tool and the model to identify the plant in the input image and decide whether or not it has a disease. Add images or other descriptions for your project here.
